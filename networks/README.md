# Breakout Group: Introduction to Networks

# What is Network Science?
Network science uses graph theory, statistics and probability theory, data mining, and information visualization to allow us to *predict* and *control* real-world networks we encounter.

# What will we learn?
We will study several topics in this breakout group:
1. *Models of random and real networks*
2. *Common structural properties of graphs*
3. *Diffusion processes across networks*
4. *Models of infection spreading*

# What do you need to be prepared?
This tutorial uses ipython notebooks with the python-igraph library. You will need to have both installed to run the code.
*ipython* - https://ipython.org/install.html
*igraph* - http://igraph.org/python/
