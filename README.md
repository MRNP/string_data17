# Workshop on Data Science and String Theory

This is the public code repository for the String Data meeting held at Northeastern University
from November 30 - December 2, 2017. 

The primary purpose of the repository is to contain the code that is used in the coding session of 
three of the breakout groups:
1. **Network Science**, Will Cunningham, Northeastern University. 
2. **Supervised Machine Learning**, Sven Krippendorf, LMU Munich.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**, Fabian Ruehle, Oxford.
However, any participant that would like to contribute code to the meeting is welcome to. Please
e-mail Jim Halverson for push access.

The codes for the three breakout groups are in appropriately named subfolders, and all will be
available a few days before the workshop. Participants are encouraged to download and run the code
ahead of time so that they can follow along in real-time. To do so,
1. **Obtain the Repository**. If you are familiar with Git, this can be done by running <br>
`git clone https://github.com/jimhalverson/string_data17.git`
from a terminal. Otherwise, click download zip on this
page.
2. **Open a Terminal**. 
3. **Run Codes**, by browing to directory and following instructions in the local README.
