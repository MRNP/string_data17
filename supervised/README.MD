## Problems

Classify data in two classes for problems like this:

## Code

The notebooks (notebook01.nb-notebook03.nb) give an example of Support Vector Machines applied to the classification problems shown in the images above.

## Software

Currently this is based on Mathematica. Some features will require v.11.1.1.0 or higher. I have also uploaded a .pdf of the respective notebooks in case Mathematica is not available on your machine.
